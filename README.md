# Minishell

Minishell is a challenging project undertaken as part of the 42 curriculum. This project aims to replicate the functionality of the bash shell. At 42, Minishell is crafted entirely from the ground up and stands as one of the most demanding projects in the curriculum.

## Project Overview

Minishell serves as a platform for students to deepen their understanding of shell scripting and system-level programming. By recreating the core functionalities of a Unix-like shell, participants gain valuable insights into process management, parsing, and command execution. This project is an opportunity to explore the inner workings of a fundamental tool used in the Unix ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **Bash Replication**: Minishell faithfully emulates the behavior of the bash shell, providing users with a familiar interface and feature set.

- **From Scratch**: The Minishell project is implemented entirely from scratch, allowing students to develop a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms of a shell.

- **Curriculum Challenge**: As one of the flagship projects in the 42 curriculum, Minishell pushes students to apply their knowledge and problem-solving skills to create a functional and efficient shell.

## How to Use

To use Minishell, follow the installation and usage instructions provided in the project's documentation. You can find detailed information on building, running, and testing the shell in the project's repository.
