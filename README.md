# Minishell

Minishell is a challenging project undertaken as part of the 42 curriculum. This project aims to replicate the functionality of the bash shell. At 42, Minishell is crafted entirely from the ground up and stands as one of the most demanding projects in the curriculum.

## Project Overview

Minishell serves as a platform for students to deepen their understanding of shell scripting and system-level programming. By recreating the core functionalities of a Unix-like shell, participants gain valuable insights into process management, parsing, and command execution. This project is an opportunity to explore the inner workings of a fundamental tool used in the Unix ecosystem.
